In chemistry, the molar mass of a substance is the mass in grams of one mole of the substance (grams / mole). A mole is simply a fixed very large quantity, specifically 602,214,076,000,000,000,000,000 (usually written as 6.02214076 Ã— 1023). A molar mass calculator is a program that computes the molar mass of a substance and the number of moles of a sample of that substance. To use a molar mass calculator, a chemist enters two inputs:  The formula for a molecule, such as H2O (water) or C6H12O6 (glucose) The mass in grams of a sample, such as 3.71 The calculator computes the molar mass of the molecule by doing the following for each element in the formula:  Sum the number of atoms of each element in the formula Find the atomic mass of each element Multiply the number of atoms by their atomic mass Add the product into the molar mass of the molecule Then the calculator divides the mass of the sample by the molar mass which results in the number of moles in the sample. The calculator then prints two results for the chemist to see:  the molar mass the number of moles
